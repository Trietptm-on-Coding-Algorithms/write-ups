\begin{abstract}
  The reverse engineering challenge \texttt{F4b\_XOR\_W4kfu} proposed in the CTF of the security conference Grehack $2015$ captures our interest since it have implemented novel obfuscation techniques. This is also the challenge of highest point over all categories of the CTF:~cryptography, exploit, reverse engineering, etc. This writeup presents our approach and result obtained in examining the challenge.
