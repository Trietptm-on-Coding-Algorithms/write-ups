\begin{abstract}
  The reverse engineering challenge \texttt{F4b\_XOR\_W4kfu} proposed in the CTF of the security conference Grehack $2015$ captures our interest since its novel obfuscation techniques. This is also the challenge of the highest point over all categories of the CTF:~cryptography, exploit, reverse engineering, etc. This writeup presents our approach and result obtained in analyzing the challenge.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\texttt{F4b\_XOR\_W4kfu} is a 32 bits \texttt{PE} binary, it seems to be a very classic reverse engineering challenge at first sight, without any fancy GUI, it simply requests for an input from the standard input, then prints \texttt{Nop!} or \texttt{Yes!} depending on whether the input is correct or not. We can also notice that the challenge runs a little bit slow.
